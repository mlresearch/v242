    abstract = {We address two major challenges in scientific machine learning (SciML): interpretability and computational efficiency. We increase the interpretability of certain learning processes by establishing a new theoretical connection between optimization problems arising from SciML and a generalized Hopf formula, which represents the viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (HJ PDE) with time-dependent Hamiltonian. Namely, we show that when we solve certain regularized learning problems with integral-type losses, we actually solve an optimal control problem and its associated HJ PDE with time-dependent Hamiltonian. This connection allows us to reinterpret incremental updates to learned models as the evolution of an associated HJ PDE and optimal control problem in time, where all of the previous information is intrinsically encoded in the solution to the HJ PDE. As a result, existing HJ PDE solvers and optimal control algorithms can be reused to design new efficient training approaches for SciML that naturally coincide with the continual learning framework, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. As a first exploration of this connection, we consider the special case of linear regression and leverage our connection to develop a new Riccati-based methodology for solving these learning problems that is amenable to continual learning applications. We also provide some corresponding numerical examples that demonstrate the potential computational and memory advantages our Riccati-based approach can provide.}

    abstract = {Model-based RL/control have gained significant traction in robotics. Yet, these approaches often remain data-inefficient and lack the explainability of hand-engineered solutions. This makes them difficult to debug/integrate in safety-critical settings. However, in many systems, prior knowledge of environment kinematics/dynamics is available. Incorporating such priors can help address the aforementioned problems by reducing problem complexity and the need for exploration, while also facilitating the expression of the decisions taken by the agent in terms of physically meaningful entities. Our aim with this paper is to illustrate and support this point of view via a case-study. We model a payload manipulation problem based on a real robotic system, and show that leveraging prior knowledge about the dynamics of the environment in an MPC framework can lead to improvements in explainability, safety and data-efficiency, leading to satisfying generalization properties with less data.}

Leveraging insights from this framework and recognizing the significance of redundant and conflicting constraint conditions, we introduce the Gradient Shaping (GradS) method for general Lagrangian-based safe RL algorithms to improve the training efficiency in terms of both reward and constraint satisfaction. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method in encouraging exploration and learning a policy that improves both safety and reward performance across various challenging MC safe RL tasks as well as good scalability to the constraint dimension.}

The learning model is aware when a new mode appears, but it cannot access the true modes of individual training sequences. The state-of-the-art continual learning approaches cannot handle this setup, because parameter transfer suffers from catastrophic interference and episodic memory design requires the knowledge of the ground-truth modes of sequences. We devise a novel continual learning method that overcomes both limitations by maintaining a descriptor of the mode of an encountered sequence in a neural episodic memory. We employ a Dirichlet Process prior on the attention weights of the memory to foster efficient storage of the mode descriptors. Our method performs continual learning by transferring knowledge across tasks by retrieving the descriptors of similar modes of past tasks to the mode of a current sequence and feeding this descriptor into its transition kernel as control input. We observe the continual learning performance of our method to compare favorably to the mainstream parameter transfer approach.}

    pages = {52--67},
    abstract = {Designing stabilizing controllers is a fundamental challenge in autonomous systems, particularly for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems that can hardly be accurately modeled with differential equations. The Lyapunov theory offers a solution for stabilizing control systems, still, current methods relying on Lyapunov functions require access to complete dynamics or samples of system executions throughout the entire state space. Consequently, they are impractical for high-dimensional systems. This paper introduces a novel framework, LYapunov-Guided Exploration (LYGE), for learning stabilizing controllers tailored to high-dimensional, unknown systems. LYGE employs Lyapunov theory to iteratively guide the search for samples during exploration while simultaneously learning the local system dynamics, control policy, and Lyapunov functions. We demonstrate its scalability on highly complex systems, including a high-fidelity F-16 jet model featuring a 16D state space and a 4D input space. Experiments indicate that, compared to prior works in reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and neural certificates, LYGE reduces the distance to the goal by 50\% whil<e requiring only 5\% to 32\% of the samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be extended to learn controllers guided by other certificate functions for unknown systems.}

    pages = {68--79},
    abstract = {One of the fundamental challenges associated with reinforcement learning (RL) is that collecting sufficient data can be both time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we formalize a concept of time reversal symmetry in a Markov decision process (MDP), which builds upon the established structure of dynamically reversible Markov chains (DRMCs) and time-reversibility in classical physics. Specifically, we investigate the utility of this concept in reducing the sample complexity of reinforcement learning. We observe that utilizing the structure of time reversal in an MDP allows every environment transition experienced by an agent to be transformed into a feasible reverse-time transition, effectively doubling the number of experiences in the environment. To test the usefulness of this newly synthesized data, we develop a novel approach called time symmetric data augmentation (TSDA) and investigate its application in both proprioceptive and pixel-based state within the realm of off-policy, model-free RL. Empirical evaluations showcase how these synthetic transitions can enhance the sample efficiency of RL agents in time reversible scenarios without friction or contact. We also test this method in more realistic environments where these assumptions are not globally satisfied. We find that TSDA can significantly degrade sample efficiency and policy performance, but can also improve sample efficiency under the right conditions. Ultimately we conclude that time symmetry shows promise in enhancing the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning and provide guidance when the environment and reward structures are of an appropriate form for TSDA to be employed effectively.}

We present, for the first time, an efficient online method to compute an $\varepsilon$-minimax strategy profile, which requires only one linear program to be solved for each agent at every stage, instead of a complex estimation of opponent counterfactual values. For the partially-informed agent, we propose a continual resolving approach which uses lower bounds, pre-computed offline with heuristic search value iteration (HSVI), instead of opponent counterfactual values. This inherits the soundness of continual resolving at the cost of pre-computing the bound. For the fully-informed agent, we propose an inferred-belief strategy, where the agent maintains an inferred belief about the belief of the partially-informed agent based on (offline) upper bounds from HSVI, guaranteeing $\varepsilon$-distance to the value of the game at the initial belief known to both agents.}

    pages = {92--103},
    abstract = {Safe control of neural network dynamic models (NNDMs) is important to robotics and many applications. However, it remains challenging to compute an optimal safe control in real time for NNDM. To enable real-time computation, we propose to use a sound approximation of the NNDM in the control synthesis. In particular, we propose Bernstein over-approximated neural dynamics (BOND) based on the Bernstein polynomial over-approximation (BPO) of ReLU activation functions in NNDM. To mitigate the errors introduced by the approximation and to ensure persistent feasibility of the safe control problems, we synthesize a worst-case safety index using the most unsafe approximated state within the BPO relaxation of NNDM offline. For the online real-time optimization, we formulate the first-order Taylor approximation of the nonlinear worst-case safety constraint as an additional linear layer of NNDM with the l2 bounded bias term for the higher-order remainder. Comprehensive experiments with different neural dynamics and safety constraints show that with safety guaranteed, our NNDMs with sound approximation are 10-100 times faster than the safe control baseline that uses mixed integer programming (MIP), validating the effectiveness of the worst-case safety index and scalability of the proposed BOND in real-time large-scale settings.}

    pages = {104--116},
    abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) for robot control typically requires a detailed representation of the environment state, including information about task-relevant objects not directly measurable. Keypoint detectors, such as spatial autoencoders (SAEs), are a common approach to extracting a low-dimensional representation from high-dimensional image data. SAEs aim at spatial features such as object positions, which are often useful representations in robotic RL. However, whether an SAE is actually able to track objects in the scene and thus yields a spatial state representation well suited for RL tasks has rarely been examined due to a lack of established metrics. In this paper, we propose to assess the performance of an SAE instance by measuring how well keypoints track ground truth objects in images. We present a computationally lightweight metric and use it to evaluate common baseline SAE architectures on image data from a simulated robot task. We find that common SAEs differ substantially in their spatial extraction capability. Furthermore, we validate that SAEs that perform well in our metric achieve superior performance when used in downstream RL. Thus, our metric is an effective and lightweight indicator of RL performance before executing expensive RL training. Building on these insights, we identify three key modifications of SAE architectures to improve tracking performance. We make our code available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/sae-rl.}

In this article, a deep learning approach is proposed to control multi-input HVAC systems in order to minimize both thermal discomfort and operational cost. More particularly, an LSTM-based encoder-decoder process model, trained on historical weather data and control sequences generated while the building was steered by a modern rule-based controller (RBC), is fed into an optimisation problem, to which a change of variables is applied to efficiently model the effect of interdependent control inputs. Both the nonlinear LSTM process model and the cost function of the optimisation problem are linearised to formulate the control problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which ensures that the controller can operate in near real-time and with limited computational power. Moreover, to avoid resorting to model extrapolation and to improve the model's predictive performance, the set of allowed control signal values is restricted using a quantile-based approach. In addition to the purely data-driven controller (DDC), a hybrid controller is designed to leverage the strengths of the RBC and the DDC. The performance of both controllers is benchmarked against the RBC's performance using the BOPTEST simulation environment under various experiment settings, highlighting how the hyperparameters affect the controller's performance. Compared to the RBC, we show that the proposed controllers realise substantial improvements in terms of both thermal comfort and operational cost while controlling a single zone or two zones simultaneously.}

    abstract = {The macroscopic traffic flow model is widely used for traffic control and management. To incorporate drivers' anticipative behaviors and to remove impractical speed discontinuity inherent in the classic Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) traffic model, nonlocal partial differential equation (PDE) models with ``look-ahead'' dynamics have been proposed, which assume that the speed is a function of weighted downstream traffic density. However, it lacks data validation on two important questions: whether there exist nonlocal dynamics, and how the length and weight of the ``look-ahead'' window affect the spatial temporal propagation of traffic densities. In this paper, we adopt traffic trajectory data from a ring-road experiment and design a physics-informed neural network to learn the fundamental diagram and look-ahead kernel that best fit the data, and reinvent a data-enhanced nonlocal LWR model via minimizing the loss function combining the data discrepancy and the nonlocal model discrepancy. Results show that the learned nonlocal LWR yields a more accurate prediction of traffic wave propagation in three different scenarios: stop-and-go oscillations, congested, and free traffic. We first demonstrate the existence of ``look-ahead'' effect with real traffic data. The optimal nonlocal kernel is found out to take a length of around 35 to 50 meters, and the kernel weight within 5 meters accounts for the majority of the nonlocal effect. Our results also underscore the importance of choosing a priori physics in machine learning models.}

Focusing on domains where 1) users' optimal demand can only be induced through posted prices, 2) real-time two-way communication with the users is not available, 3) the induced demand must always belong to an arbitrarily shaped convex and compact feasible set in spite of price response uncertainty, and 4) the users' response to prices are evolving over time, we design SPNUM-GV to generate prices that ensure stage-wise safety of the induced demand while achieving sublinear regret. SPNUM-GV ensures safety by determining a ``desired demand'' within a shrunk feasible set using a projected gradient method and updating the prices to induce a demand close to the desired demand by leveraging an estimate of the users' price response function. By tuning the amount of shrinkage to account for the error between the desired and the induced demand, we prove that the induced demand always belongs to the feasible set. In addition, we prove that the regret incurred by the induced demand is ${\cal O}(\sqrt{T(1+V_T)})$ after $T$ iterations, where $V_T$ is an upper bound on the total gradual variations of the users' utility functions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of SPNUM-GV and support our theoretical findings.}

To address this problem, we propose an algorithm that leverages forward-difference gradient estimation as well as optimistic and pessimistic action sets to achieve $O(d \sqrt{T})$ regret and zero constraint violation under the assumption that the constraint function is smooth and strongly convex. We then perform a numerical study to investigate the impacts of the unknown constraint and zero-order feedback on empirical performance.}

Concepts known as Explainable Artificial Intelligence are being developed to improve the interpretability of black box models. This work combines the popular Explainable Artificial Intelligence method Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) with data-driven model predictive control to increase the interpretability of artificial neural networks used as process models during model creation. Using a standardised residual building energy system for controller testing, an in-depth analysis of how the models make predictions is carried out. In addition, the influence of different model setups on the control performance is evaluated. The results show that the different control performances can be justified by analysing the underlying models with SHAP.

    abstract = {Image-based reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in generalization when the visual environment undergoes substantial changes between training and deployment. Under such circumstances, learned policies may not perform well leading to degraded results. Previous approaches to this problem have largely focused on broadening the training observation distribution, employing techniques like data augmentation and domain randomization. However, given the sequential nature of the RL decision-making problem, it is often the case that residual errors are propagated by the learned policy model and accumulate throughout the trajectory, resulting in highly degraded performance. In this paper, we leverage the observation that predicted rewards under domain shift, even though imperfect, can still be a useful signal to guide fine-tuning. We exploit this property to fine-tune a policy using reward prediction in the target domain. We have found that, even under significant domain shift, the predicted reward can still provide meaningful signal and fine-tuning substantially improves the original policy. Our approach, termed Predicted Reward Fine-tuning (PRFT), improves performance across diverse tasks in both simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

    author = {Teichrib, Dieter and Darup, Moritz Schulze},
    pages = {337--348},
    abstract = {Piecewise regression is a versatile approach used in various disciplines to approximate complex functions from limited, potentially noisy data points. In control, piecewise regression is, e.g., used to approximate the optimal control law of model predictive control (MPC), the optimal value function, or unknown system dynamics. Neural networks are a common choice to solve the piecewise regression problem. However, due to their nonlinear structure, training is often based on gradient-based methods, which may fail to find a global optimum or even a solution that leads to a small approximation error. To overcome this problem and to find a global optimal solution, methods based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) can be used. However, the known MIP-based methods are either limited to a special class of functions, e.g., convex piecewise affine functions, or they lead to complex approximations in terms of the number of regions of the piecewise defined function. Both complicate a usage in the framework of control. We propose a new MIP-based method that is not restricted to a particular class of piecewise defined functions and leads to functions that are fast to evaluate and can be used within an optimization problem, making them well suited for use in control.}

    abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a method to control nonlinear systems with guaranteed stability and constraint satisfaction but suffers from high computation times. Approximate MPC (AMPC) with neural networks (NNs) has emerged to address this limitation, enabling deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. However, when tuning AMPCs for real-world systems, large datasets need to be regenerated and the NN needs to be retrained at every tuning step. This work introduces a novel, parameter-adaptive AMPC architecture capable of online tuning without recomputing large datasets and retraining. By incorporating local sensitivities of nonlinear programs, the proposed method not only mimics optimal MPC inputs but also adjusts to known changes in physical parameters of the model using linear predictions while still guaranteeing stability. We showcase the effectiveness of parameter-adaptive AMPC by controlling the swing-ups of two different real cartpole systems with a severely resource-constrained microcontroller (MCU). We use the same NN across both system instances that have different parameters. This work not only represents the first experimental demonstration of AMPC for fast-moving systems on low-cost MCUs to the best of our knowledge, but also showcases generalization across system instances and variations through our parameter-adaptation method. Taken together, these contributions represent a marked step toward the practical application of AMPC in real-world systems.}

Application of MPC requires solving an optimization problem at every sampling instant, making it challenging to implement on embedded hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that combines a tightened soft constrained MPC formulation with a supervised learning framework to approximate the MPC value function. This combination enables us to obtain a corresponding optimal control law, which can be implemented efficiently on embedded platforms. The proposed framework ensures stability and constraint satisfaction for various nonlinear systems. While the design effort is similar to the design of nominal MPC formulations, we can establish input-to-state stability (ISS) with respect to the approximation error of the value function. Moreover, we prove that, while the optimal control law may be discontinuous, the value function corresponding to the soft constrained MPC problem is Lipschitz continuous for Lipschitz continuous systems. This serves two purposes: First, it allows to relate approximation errors to a sufficiently large constraint tightening to obtain constraint satisfaction guarantees. Secondly, it enables a very efficient supervised learning procedure for obtaining the approximation using continuous function approximator classes. We showcase the effectiveness of the method through a nonlinear numerical example.}

This approach addresses the limitations of commonly learned controllers with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or other general neural network architecture in deep reinforcement learning, in terms of explainability and performance guarantees. The learned controllers not only possess verifiable properties like persistent feasibility and asymptotic stability akin to MPC, but they also empirically match MPC and MLP controllers in control performance. Moreover, they are more computationally efficient in implementation compared to MPC and require significantly fewer learnable policy parameters than MLP controllers. Practical application is demonstrated through a vehicle drift maneuvering task, showcasing the potential of these controllers in real-world scenarios.}

However, the uniqueness of the solution to the Bellman equation with two discount factors has not been explicitly discussed. We demonstrate with an example that when one of the discount factors is set to one, as allowed in many previous works, the Bellman equation may have multiple solutions, leading to inaccurate evaluation of the expected return. We then propose a condition for the Bellman equation to have the expected return as the unique solution, requiring the solutions for states inside a rejecting bottom strongly connected component (BSCC) to be $0$. We prove this condition is sufficient by showing that the solutions for the states with discounting can be separated from those for the states without discounting under this condition.}

We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.}

These connections motivate our novel control framework with signature transforms that efficiently generalizes the Bellman equation to the space of trajectories. We analyze the properties and advantages of the framework, termed signature control. In particular, we demonstrate that (i) it can naturally deal with varying/adaptive time steps; (ii) it propagates higher-level information more efficiently than value function updates; (iii) it is robust to dynamical system misspecification over long rollouts. As a specific case of our framework, we devise a model predictive control method for path tracking. This method generalizes integral control, being suitable for problems with unknown disturbances.

We approximate the true disturbance set at each time step with a parameterised set, which is referred to as a quantified disturbance set, using disturbance realisations. A key novelty is that the parameterisation of these quantified disturbance sets enjoys desirable properties such that the quantified disturbance set and its corresponding rigid tube bounding disturbance propagation can be efficiently updated online. We provide statistical gaps between the true and quantified disturbance sets, based on which, probabilistic recursive feasibility of MPC optimisation problems is discussed.

By leveraging expressive architectures such as neural networks, these frameworks aim to improve both the model accuracy and the control performance of the system, through the construction of accurate data-driven representations of the system dynamics. Despite achieving significant performance improvements over their non-learning counterparts, there are often little or no guarantees on how these model-based controllers with learned models would perform in the presence of uncertainty. In particular, under the influence of modeling errors, noise and exogenous disturbances, it is challenging to ascertain the accuracy of these learned models. In some cases, constraints may even be violated, rendering the controllers unsafe. In this work, we propose a novel framework that can be applied to a large class of model-based controllers and alleviates the above mentioned issues by robustifying the model-based controllers in an online and modular manner, with provable guarantees on the model accuracy and constraint satisfaction. The framework first deploys conformal prediction to generate finite-sample, provably valid uncertainty regions for the dynamics model in a distribution-free manner. These uncertainty regions are incorporated into the constraints through a dynamic constraint tightening procedure. Together with the formulation of a predictive reference generator, a set of robustified reference trajectories are generated and incorporated into the model-based controller. Using two practical case studies, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology not only produces well-calibrated uncertainty regions that establish the accuracy of the models, but also enables the closed-loop system to satisfy constraints in a robust yet non-conservative manner.}

Our framework leverages neural operators to design control strategies for traffic flow systems. The traffic dynamics are described by the Aw-Rascle- Zhang (ARZ) model, which consists of second-order coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The backstepping method which involves constructing and solving a backstepping control kernel is widely used for boundary control of such PDE systems, but it requires intensive depth of expertise and can be time-consuming. To overcome these challenges, we present two distinct neural operator (NO) learning schemes aimed at stabilizing the traffic PDE system. The first scheme embeds NO-approximated gain kernels within a predefined backstepping controller, while the second one directly learns a boundary control law. The Lyapunov analysis is conducted to evaluate the stability of the NO-approximated gain kernels and control law. It is proved that the NO-based closed-loop system is practical stable under certain approximation accuracy conditions. To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the two neural operator controllers with a PDE backstepping controller and a Proportional Integral (PI) controller. While the NO-approximated methods exhibit larger errors compared to the backstepping controller, they consistently outperform the PI controller, demonstrating faster computation speeds across all scenarios. This result suggests that neural operators can significantly expedite and simplify the process of obtaining boundary controllers for freeway traffic stabilization systems.}

In a centralized Bayesian learning setting, we study two variants of the subset selection problem: (i) selecting a minimum cost information set to ensure that the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis is below a desired bound and (ii) selecting an optimal information set under a limited budget to minimize the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the objective (or constraints) of these combinatorial optimization problems are weak (or approximate) submodular, and establish high-probability performance guarantees for greedy algorithms. Further, we propose an alternate metric for information set selection which is based on the total penalty of misclassification. We prove that this metric is submodular and establish near-optimal guarantees for the greedy algorithms for both the information set selection problems.

To operate in such environments, robots must have robust obstacle avoidance and versatile goal conditioning acquired from only a few simple demonstrations. Existing approaches, however, fall short of these requirements. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) enables a robot to learn complex manipulation tasks but is often limited to small task spaces in the real world due to sample inefficiency and safety concerns. Motion planning (MP) can generate collision-free paths in obstructed environments, but cannot solve complex manipulation tasks and requires goal states often specified by a user or object-specific pose estimator. In this work, we propose a robust system for efficient skill acquisition designed to address complex insertion tasks in obstructed environments. Our system leverages an object-centric generative model (OCGM) for versatile goal identification to specify a goal for MP combined with RL to solve complex manipulation tasks in obstructed environments. Particularly, OCGM enables one-shot target object identification and re-identification in new scenes, allowing MP to guide the robot to the target object while avoiding obstacles. This is combined with a skill transition network, which bridges the gap between terminal states of MP and feasible start states of a sample-efficient RL policy. The experiments demonstrate that our OCGM-based one-shot goal identification provides competitive accuracy to other baseline approaches and that our modular framework outperforms competitive baselines, including a state-of-the-art RL algorithm, by a significant margin for complex manipulation tasks in obstructed environments.}

Further, for a candidate value function obtained via numerical approximation, we provide a bound of suboptimality based on its Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation residuals. Inspired by Holzh\"{u}ter (2004), we then design an algorithm that solves backwards the Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) ODE from terminal conditions provided by the locally optimal LQR value function. This numerical procedure leads to a piece-wise C1 value function whose nonsmooth region contains periodic spiral lines and smooth regions attain HJB residuals about $10^{-4}$, hence certiﬁed to be the optimal value function up to minor numerical inaccuracies. This optimal value function checks the power of optimality: (i) it sits above a polynomial lower bound; (ii) its induced controller globally swings up and stabilizes the pendulum, and (iii) attains lower trajectory cost than baseline methods such as energy shaping, model predictive control (MPC), and proximal policy optimization (with MPC attaining almost the same cost). We conclude by distilling the optimal value function into a simple neural network.}

In this work, we consider the problem of steering the distribution of a discrete-time, linear system subject to exogenous disturbances under an unknown dynamics model. Leveraging concepts from behavioral systems theory, the trajectories of this unknown, noisy system may be (approximately) represented using system data collected through experimentation. Using this fact, we formulate a direct data-driven covariance control problem using input-state data. We then propose a maximum likelihood uncertainty quantification method to estimate and bound the noise realizations in the data collection process. Lastly, we utilize robust convex optimization techniques to solve the resulting norm-bounded uncertain convex program. We illustrate the proposed end-to-end data-driven CS algorithm on a double integrator example and showcase the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed method compared to that of model-based methods.}

In contrast, classical model-based control offers stability guarantees but usually underperforms the machine-learned black-box controller. This motivates us to combine machine-learned black-box and model-based controllers. Due to the nonconvexity of the space of stable controllers, a simple convex combination of the two controllers can lead to instability. We propose using Disturbance Response Control (DRC) to reparameterize the two controllers, ensuring the convexity of the stable controller space. We then propose lambdaCLEAC, which adaptively combines the machine-learned black-box controller and the model-based controller in the DRC parameterization. We prove that our approach achieves the best of both worlds: stability as in model-based control and similar regret bounds as the machine-learned controller.}

    abstract = {Emerging mobility systems are increasingly capable of recommending options to mobility users, to guide them towards personalized yet sustainable system outcomes. Even more so than the typical recommendation system, it is crucial to minimize regret, because 1) the mobility options directly affect the lives of the users, and 2) the system sustainability relies on sufficient user participation. In this study, we thus consider accelerating user preference learning by exploiting a low-dimensional latent space that captures the mobility preferences of users within a population. We therefore introduce a hierarchical contextual bandit framework named Expert with Clustering (EWC), which integrates clustering techniques and prediction with expert advice. EWC efficiently utilizes hierarchical user information and incorporates a novel Loss-guided Distance metric. This metric is instrumental in generating more representative cluster centroids, thereby enhancing the performance of recommendation systems. In a recommendation scenario with \(N\) users, \(T\) rounds per user, and \(K\) options, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of \(O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)\). This bound consists of two parts: the first term is the regret from the Hedge algorithm, and the second term depends on the average loss from clustering. The algorithm performs with low regret, especially when a latent hierarchical structure exists among users. This regret bound underscores the theoretical and experimental efficacy of EWC, particularly in scenarios that demand rapid learning and adaptation. Experimental results highlight that EWC can substantially reduce regret by 27.57\% compared to the LinUCB baseline. Our work offers a data-efficient approach to capturing both individual and collective behaviors, making it highly applicable to contexts with hierarchical structures. We expect the algorithm to be applicable to other settings with layered nuances of user preferences and information.}

    abstract = {Learning-based approaches for controlling safety-critical autonomous systems are rapidly growing in popularity; thus, it is important to provide rigorous and robust assurances on their performance and safety. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for providing such guarantees, since it can handle general nonlinear system dynamics, bounded adversarial system disturbances, and state and input constraints. However, it involves solving a Partial Differential Equation (PDE), whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with respect to the state dimension, making its direct use on large-scale systems intractable. To overcome this challenge, neural approaches, such as DeepReach, have been used to synthesize reachable tubes and safety controllers for high-dimensional systems. However, verifying these neural reachable tubes remains challenging. In this work, we propose two different verification methods, based on robust scenario optimization and conformal prediction, to provide probabilistic safety guarantees for neural reachable tubes. Our methods allow a direct trade-off between resilience to outlier errors in the neural tube, which are inevitable in a learning-based approach, and the strength of the probabilistic safety guarantee. Furthermore, we show that split conformal prediction, a widely used method in the machine learning community for uncertainty quantification, reduces to a scenario-based approach, making the two methods equivalent not only for verification of neural reachable tubes but also more generally. To our knowledge, our proof is the first in the literature to show a strong relationship between the highly related but disparate fields of conformal prediction and scenario optimization. Finally, we propose an outlier-adjusted verification approach that harnesses information about the error distribution in neural reachable tubes to recover greater safe volumes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches for the high-dimensional problems of multi-vehicle collision avoidance and rocket landing with no-go zones.}

We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.}

Since this problem is intractable in general, we focus on the Linear Quadratic setting to enable derive benchmark solutions. First, since no standard theory exists for this problem due to the distributed information structure, we utilize the Mean-Field Type Game (MFTG) paradigm to establish guarantees on the solution quality in the sense of achieved Nash equilibrium of the MFTG. This in turn allows us to compare the performance against the corresponding original robust multi-agent control problem. Then, we propose a Receding-horizon Gradient Descent Ascent RL algorithm to find the MFTG Nash equilibrium and we prove a non-asymptotic rate of convergence.

We assume players can receive only realizations of their payoffs, and that the players can not observe the states and actions of other players, nor do they know the transition probability matrices of their own Markov chain. Relying on a compact dual formulation of the game based on occupancy measures and the technique of confidence set to maintain high-probability estimates of the unknown transition matrices, we propose a fully decentralized mirror descent algorithm to learn an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium stationary policy for this class of games. The proposed algorithm has the desired properties of independence and convergence. Specifically, assuming the existence of a variationally stable Nash equilibrium policy, we show that the proposed algorithm in which players make their decisions independently and in a decentralized fashion converges asymptotically to the stable $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium stationary policy with arbitrarily high probability.}

(2) How can we computationally handle both nonlinear ODE constraints and parameter uncertainties for a generic stochastic optimization problem for resource allocation? To the best of our knowledge current literature does not fully resolve these questions. Here, we develop a data-driven approach to represent parameter uncertainty accurately and tractably in a novel stochastic optimization problem formulation. We first generate a tractable scenario set by estimating the distribution on ODE model parameters using Bayesian inference with Gaussian processes. Next, we develop a parallelized solution algorithm that accounts for scenario-dependent nonlinear ODE constraints. Our scenario-set generation procedure and solution approach are flexible in that they can handle any compartmental epidemiological ODE model. Our computational experiments on two different non-linear ODE models (SEIR and SEPIHR) indicate that accounting for uncertainty in key epidemiological parameters can improve the efficacy of time-critical allocation decisions by 4-8\%. This improvement can be attributed to data-driven and optimal (strategic) nature of vaccine allocations.}

In the offline setting, standard off-policy algorithms will overestimate values of out-of-distribution actions and a policy trained naively in this way will perform poorly in the environment due to distribution shift between the implied and real environment; this is especially likely when modelling complex and multi-modal data distributions. We propose Scaled-penalty Offline Learning (SpOiLer), an offline reinforcement learning algorithm that reduces the value of out-of-distribution actions relative to observed actions. The resultant pessimistic value function is a lower bound of the true value function and manipulates the policy towards selecting actions present in the dataset. Our method is a simple augmentation to the standard Bellman backup operator and implementation requires around 15 additional lines of code over soft actor-critic. We provide theoretical insights into how SpOiLer operates under the hood and show empirically that SpOiLer achieves remarkable performance against prior methods on a range of tasks.}

To further enhance its efficiency, reduced physical models of the system can be incorporated into the optimization process, accelerating it. These models are able to offer an approximation of the actual system, and evaluating them is significantly cheaper. The similarity between the model and reality is represented by additional hyperparameters, which are learned within the optimization process. Safety is a crucial criterion for online optimization methods such as Bayesian optimization, which has been addressed by recent works that provide safety guarantees under the assumption of known hyperparameters. In practice, however, this does not apply. Therefore, we extend the robust Gaussian process uniform error bounds to meet the multi-task setting, which involves the calculation of a confidence region from the hyperparameter posterior distribution utilizing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Subsequently, the robust safety bounds are employed to facilitate the safe optimization of the system, while incorporating measurements of the models. Simulation results indicate that the optimization can be significantly accelerated for expensive to evaluate functions in comparison to other state-of-the-art safe Bayesian optimization methods, contingent on the fidelity of the models.}

Specifically, we propose a theoretically motivated formulation that mixes the output probabilities of a standard neural network and a robust neural network. Both of these base classifiers are pre-trained, and thus our method does not require additional training. Our numerical experiments verify that the mixed classifier noticeably improves the accuracy-robustness trade-off and identify the confidence property of the robust base classifier as the key leverage of this more benign trade-off. Our theoretical results prove that under mild assumptions, when the robustness of the robust base model is certifiable, no alteration or attack within a closed-form $l_p$ radius on an input can result in misclassification of the mixed classifier.}

This strategy has vast potential in adaptive control, where it is necessary to rapidly adapt to changing conditions with limited data. Toward concretely understanding the benefit of pre-training for adaptive control, we study the adaptive linear quadratic control problem in the setting where the learner has prior knowledge of a collection of basis matrices for the dynamics. This basis is misspecified in the sense that it cannot perfectly represent the dynamics of the underlying data generating process. We propose an algorithm that uses this prior knowledge, and prove upper bounds on the expected regret after $T$ interactions with the system. In the regime where $T$ is small, the upper bounds are dominated by a term scales with either $\texttt{poly}(\log T)$ or $\sqrt{T}$, depending on the prior knowledge available to the learner. When $T$ is large, the regret is dominated by a term that grows with $\delta T$, where $\delta$ quantifies the level of misspecification. This linear term arises due to the inability to perfectly estimate the underlying dynamics using the misspecified basis, and is therefore unavoidable unless the basis matrices are also adapted online. However, it only dominates for large $T$, after the sublinear terms arising due to the error in estimating the weights for the basis matrices become negligible. We provide simulations that validate our analysis. Our simulations also show that offline data from a collection of related systems can be used as part of a pre-training stage to estimate a misspecified dynamics basis, which is in turn used by our adaptive controller.}

The linear convergence also holds when the subproblems of PPM are solved inexactly with a proper control of inexactness.}

    abstract = {Fast and Safe Tracking (FaSTrack) is a modular framework that provides safety guarantees while planning and executing trajectories in real time via value functions of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability. These value functions are computed through dynamic programming, which is notorious for being computationally inefficient. Moreover, the resulting trajectory does not adapt online to the environment, such as sudden disturbances or obstacles. DeepReach is a scalable deep learning method to HJ reachability that allows parameterization of states, which opens up possibilities for online adaptation to various controls and disturbances. In this paper, we propose Parametric FaSTrack, which uses DeepReach to approximate a value function that parameterizes the control bounds of the planning model. The new framework can smoothly trade off between the navigation speed and the tracking error (therefore maneuverability) while guaranteeing obstacle avoidance in a priori unknown environments. We demonstrate our method through two examples and a benchmark comparison with existing methods, showing the safety, efficiency, and faster solution times of the framework.}

In particular, neither fixed-grid nor adaptive-grid discretizations may be suitable, when they suffer from large integration error or exceed the prescribed sampling time, respectively. In this work, we take a first step at closing this gap by utilizing probabilistic numerical integrators to approximate the solution of the initial value problem, as well as the computational uncertainty associated with it, inside the optimal control problem (OCP). By taking the viewpoint of probabilistic numerics and propagating the numerical uncertainty in the cost, the OCP is reformulated such that the optimal input reduces the computational uncertainty insofar as it is beneficial for the control objective. The proposed approach is illustrated using a numerical example, and potential benefits and limitations are discussed.}

Safe BO methods, in addition, guarantee safety during the optimization process, assuming that the underlying objective function does not change. However, in real-world scenarios, time-variations frequently occur, for example, due to wear in the system or changes in operation. Utilizing standard safe BO strategies that do not address time-variations can result in failure as previous safe decisions may become unsafe over time, which we demonstrate herein. To address this, we introduce a new algorithm, Event-Triggered SafeOpt (ETSO), which adapts to changes online solely relying on the observed costs. At its core, ETSO uses an event trigger to detect significant deviations between observations and the current surrogate of the objective function. When such change is detected, the algorithm reverts to a safe backup controller, and exploration is restarted. In this way, safety is recovered and maintained across changes. We evaluate ETSO on quadcopter controller tuning, both in simulation and hardware experiments. ETSO outperforms state-of-the-art safe BO, achieving superior control performance over time while maintaining safety.}

The classic policy gradient method, however, may be expensive to implement in the multi-task settings as it requires access to the gradients of all the tasks at every iteration. To circumvent this issue, in this paper we propose to study an incremental policy gradient method, where the agent only uses the gradient of only one task at each iteration. Our main contribution is to provide theoretical results to characterize the performance of the proposed method. In particular, we show that incremental policy gradient methods converge to the optimal value of the multi-task reinforcement learning objectives at a sublinear rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, where $k$ is the number of iterations. To illustrate its performance, we apply the proposed method to solve a simple multi-task variant of GridWorld problems, where an agent seeks to find an policy to navigate effectively in different environments.}

Since offline datasets do not cover all possible situations, many methods collect additional data during online fine-tuning to improve performance. In general, these methods assume that the transition dynamics remain the same during both the offline and online phases of training. However, in many real-world applications, such as outdoor construction and navigation over rough terrain, it is common for the transition dynamics to vary between the offline and online phases. Moreover, the dynamics may vary during the online training. To address this problem of changing dynamics from offline to online RL we propose a residual learning approach that infers dynamics changes to correct the outputs of the offline solution. At the online fine-tuning phase, we train a context encoder to learn a representation that is consistent inside the current online learning environment while being able to predict dynamic transitions. Experiments in D4RL MuJoCo environments, modified to support dynamics' changes upon environment resets, show that our approach can adapt to these dynamic changes and generalize to unseen perturbations in a sample-efficient way, whilst comparison methods cannot.}

This control architecture can be implemented in general RL frameworks without modifying the algorithms. This minimally invasive way allows arguably easy integration into hierarchical RL, and improves its performance. We realize the modularity by constructing an auxiliary space through coordinate transformation. Within the auxiliary space, system dynamics can be represented as hierarchical combinations of subsystems. These subsystems converge recursively following their hierarchies, provided stable self-feedbacks. We implement this modular control architecture in PPO and hierarchical RL, and demonstrate in simulation (i) the necessity of control stability for robustness and generalization and (ii) the effectiveness in improving hierarchical RL for manipulation learning.}

Through experiments with the MIT Mini Cheetah, we show that we can learn these models offline in simulation and transfer them to the real world, optionally finetuning them as the robot collects data.

In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-observation safe RL algorithm that efficiently encodes state-wise safety constraints with unknown hazard regions through a newly introduced latent barrier-like function learning mechanism. As a joint learning framework, our approach begins by constructing a latent dynamics model with low-dimensional latent spaces derived from pixel observations. We then build and learn a latent barrier-like function on top of the latent dynamics and conduct policy optimization simultaneously, thereby improving both safety and the total expected return. Experimental evaluations on the safety-gym benchmark suite demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces safety violations throughout the training process, and demonstrates faster safety convergence compared to existing methods while achieving competitive results in reward return.}

To this end, we present an iterative distributed algorithm for this function estimation problem. Each agent solves a local estimation problem in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and uploads the function to the fusion center. At the fusion center, the functions are fused by first estimating the data points that would have generated the uploaded functions and then subsequently solving a least squares estimation problem using the estimated data from both functions. The fused function is downloaded by the agents and is subsequently used for estimation at the next iteration along with incoming data. This procedure is executed sequentially and stopped when the difference between consecutively estimated functions becomes small enough.

Existing methods have relied on certificate functions like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions. The primary motivation for our work is the recognition that ultimately, enforcing the safety constraint as a control input constraint at each state is what matters. By focusing on this constraint, we can eliminate dependence on any specific certificate function-based design. To achieve this, we define a discriminating hyperplane that shapes the half-space constraint on control input at each state, serving as a sufficient condition for safety. This concept not only generalizes over traditional safety methods but also simplifies safety filter design by eliminating dependence on specific certificate functions. We present two strategies to learn the discriminating hyperplane: (a) a supervised learning approach, using pre-verified control invariant sets for labeling, and (b) a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, which does not require such labels. The main advantage of our method, unlike conventional safe RL approaches, is the separation of performance and safety. This offers a reusable safety filter for learning new tasks, avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. As such, we believe that the new notion of the discriminating hyperplane offers a more generalizable direction towards designing safety filters, encompassing and extending existing certificate-function-based or safe RL methodologies.}

Our approach results in prediction regions that are multi-modal, so they can properly capture residuals of distributions that have multiple modes, and practical, so each region is convex and can be easily incorporated into downstream tasks, such as a motion planner using conformal prediction regions. Our method applies to general supervised learning tasks, while we illustrate its use in time-series prediction. We provide a toolbox and present illustrative case studies of F16 fighter jets and autonomous vehicles, showing an up to 68\% reduction in prediction region area.}

Focusing on the online safety prediction problem, this paper systematically investigates a flexible family of learning pipelines based on generative world models, which do not require low-dimensional states. To implement these pipelines, we overcome the challenges of missing safety labels under prediction-induced distribution shift and learning safety-informed latent representations.

When only incomplete observations of a dynamical system are available, so that some states remain hidden, it is generally not possible to learn a closed-form model in these variables using either analytic or data-driven techniques. In this work, we propose STEMFold, a spatiotemporal attention-based generative model, to learn a stochastic manifold to predict the underlying unmeasured dynamics of the multi-agent system from observations of only visible agents. Our analytical results motivate STEMFold design using a spatiotemporal graph with time anchors to effectively map the observations of visible agents to a stochastic manifold with no prior information about interaction graph topology.

In our proposed algorithm, the agents communicate their states using (a)synchronous communication and exploit the side information, e.g., regularities of the system, states, agents' communication scheme, algebraic limitations, and coupling in the system states. We provide ODMU for over-approximating the reachable sets and to control the agents under conditions with severely limited data. ODMU creates differential inclusion sets that calculate the over approximations of the reachable sets containing the unknown vector field. We show that ODMU calculates the near-optimal control and calculates an upper bound (suboptimality bound) for the error between the optimal trajectory and the trajectory calculated by ODMU. We use convex-optimization-based control to obtain the guaranteed near-optimal solution. We demonstrate the effect of side information on obtaining smaller bounds on suboptimality by applying ODMU on a system of unicycles.

In turns, the policy encoded by the actor is used to warm-start TO, closing the loop between TO and RL. In this work, we present an extension of CACTO exploiting the idea of Sobolev learning.

Our results show that the new algorithm is more efficient than the original CACTO, reducing the number of TO episodes by a factor ranging from 3 to 10, and consequently the computation time.

We present a Teacher-Student learning framework specifically tailored to address the challenge of heterogeneity between the Teacher and Student agents. Our framework is based on the concept of ``surprise'', inspired by its application in exploration incentivization in sparse-reward environments. Surprise is repurposed to enable the Teacher to detect and adapt to differences between itself and the Student. By focusing on maximizing its surprise in response to the environment while concurrently minimizing the Student's surprise in response to the demonstrations, the Teacher agent can effectively tailor its demonstrations to the Student's specific capabilities and constraints. We validate our method by demonstrating improvements in the Student's learning in control tasks within sparse-reward environments.}

A vast majority of current approaches have focused on data-augmentation methods to expand the range of perturbations that the classifier is exposed to while training. A relatively unexplored avenue that is equally promising involves sanitizing an image as a preprocessing step, depending on the nature of perturbation. In this paper, we propose to use control for learned models to recover from distribution shifts online. Specifically, our method applies a sequence of semantic-preserving transformations to bring the shifted data closer in distribution to the training set, as measured by the Wasserstein distance. Our approach is to 1) formulate the problem of distribution shift recovery as a Markov decision process, which we solve using reinforcement learning, 2) identify a minimum condition on the data for our method to be applied, which we check online using a binary classifier, and 3) employ dimensionality reduction through orthonormal projection to aid in our estimates of the Wasserstein distance. We provide theoretical evidence that orthonormal projection preserves characteristics of the data at the distributional level. We apply our distribution shift recovery approach to the ImageNet-C benchmark for distribution shifts, demonstrating an improvement in average accuracy of up to 14.21\% across a variety of state-of-the-art ImageNet classifiers. We further show that our method generalizes to composites of shifts from the ImageNet-C benchmark, achieving improvements in average accuracy of up to 9.81\%. Finally, we test our method on CIFAR-100-C and report improvements of up to 8.25\%.}

On the other hand, learning-based methods that directly predict the ACOPF solution given the load input incur little computational cost but often generates infeasible solutions (i.e. violate the constraints of ACOPF). In this work, we combine the best of both worlds --- we propose an innovated framework for learning ACOPF, where the input load is mapped to the ACOPF solution through a neural network in a computationally efficient and reliable manner. Key to our innovation is a specific-purpose ``activation function'' defined implicitly by a QCQP and a novel loss, which enforce constraint satisfaction.

In order to better compare and develop driver models, we propose going beyond driving behavior to examine how well these models reflect the cognitive activity of human drivers. In particular, we compare features extracted from human driver models with brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate this approach on three human driver models with brain activity data from two human subjects.

We propose a robust RL methodology, framed within a two-player max-min adversarial paradigm. This formulation is cast as a Probabilistic Action Robust Markov Decision Process (MDP), grounded in a cyber-physical perspective. Our methodology capitalizes on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) for Q-function exploration, facilitating iterative updates that empower both the protagonist and adversary to efficaciously explore. Notably, we extend this adversarial training paradigm to encompass robustness against delayed feedback episodes. Empirical evaluation, conducted on benchmark problems such as N-Chain and deep brain stimulation, underlines the consistent superiority of our method over baseline approaches across diverse perturbation scenarios and instances of delayed feedback.}

Specifically, a safe policy or controller is one that, with high probability, maintains the trajectory of the agent in a given safe set. While the explicit gradient of the probabilistic constraint for solving PSRL directly exists, the high variance in the estimate of the gradient hinders its performance in problems with long-horizons. An alternative that is frequently explored in the literature is to consider a cumulative safe reinforcement learning (CSRL) setting. In this setting, the estimates of the constraint's gradient have less variance but are biased (worse solutions than the PSRL) and they provide an approximate solution since they solve a relaxation of the PSRL formulation. In this work, we propose a safe reinforcement learning framework with a generalized constraint for solving the PSRL problems, which we term Generalized Safe Reinforcement Learning (GSRL). Our theoretical contributions substantiate that the proposed GSRL can recover both the PSRL and CSRL settings. In addition, it can be naturally combined with any state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms like PPO-Lagrangian, TD3-Lagrangian, CPO, PCPO, etc. We evaluate the GSRL by a series of empirical experiments in the well-known safe RL benchmark Bullet-Safety-Gym, which exhibit a better return-safety trade-off than both the PSRL and CSRL formulations.}

    abstract = {Traditionally, first-principle models are used to monitor and control dynamical systems. However, modeling complex systems using first principles can be challenging. Learning the dynamics from data using neural networks has emerged as a viable alternative. In practice, some parameters of a system may vary across different system instances, but training separate neural networks for all possible parameter combinations can be infeasible. Therefore, meta-learning using, e.g., conditional neural processes (CNPs), aims to learn a prior model over the system dynamics for various parameters. These models can then adapt on deployment to the parameters of a system instance using a context set composed of past observations. However, changes in parameters can also occur online during operation and naively adding past observations across parameter variations to the context set can distort the model's latent representation, leading to inaccurate predictions over time. This paper introduces an adaptation scheme to enable CNPs to cope with such online variations. We combine a sliding window to accommodate gradual variations with the use of event triggers to detect sudden changes. The event triggers are based on concentration inequalities, they reset the context set of the CNP once observations deviate significantly from the CNP's predictions. We validate our concepts on two nonlinear dynamical systems under parameter variations and demonstrate that our approaches decrease the prediction error over time as well as their efficacy for control.}

In a philosophical sense this method only penalizes the learner for constraint violations that it caused; in a practical sense it maintains feasibility of the optimal control problem when constraint violation is inevitable.

Regret is the difference in cost obtained by a causal controller and a clairvoyant controller with access to future disturbances. We focus on the infinite-horizon framework, which results in stability guarantees. In this DR setting, the probability distribution of the disturbances resides within a Wasserstein-2 ambiguity set centered at a specified nominal distribution. Our objective is to identify a control policy that minimizes the worst-case expected regret over an infinite horizon, considering all potential disturbance distributions within the ambiguity set. In contrast to prior works, which assume time-independent disturbances, we relax this constraint to allow for time-correlated disturbances, thus actual distributional robustness. While we show that the resulting optimal controller is non-rational and lacks a finite-dimensional state-space realization, we demonstrate that it can still be uniquely characterized by a finite dimensional parameter. Exploiting this fact, we introduce an efficient numerical method to compute the controller in the frequency domain using fixed-point iterations. This method circumvents the computational bottleneck associated with the finite-horizon problem, where the semi-definite programming (SDP) solution dimension scales with the time horizon. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of our framework.}

    abstract = {We study coalitional games with exogenous uncertainty in the coalition value, in which each agent is allowed to have private samples of the uncertainty. As a consequence, the agents may have a different perception of stability of the grand coalition. In this context, we propose a novel methodology to study the out-of-sample coalitional rationality of allocations in the set of stable allocations (i.e., the core). Our analysis builds on the framework of probably approximately correct learning. Initially, we state a priori and a posteriori guarantees for the entire core. Furthermore, we provide a distributed algorithm to compute a compression set that determines the generalization properties of the a posteriori statements. We then refine our probabilistic robustness bounds by specialising the analysis to a single payoff allocation, taking, also in this case, both a priori and a posteriori approaches. Finally, we consider a relaxed zeta-core to include nearby allocations and also address the case of empty core. For this case, probabilistic statements are given on the eventual stability of allocations in the zeta-core.}

    abstract = {Snake-inspired robots demonstrate exceptional versatility through challenging terrains such as sand, rubble, and ice. However, their high-dimensional continuous action spaces make analytical gait design challenging. Early works by Hirose (1994) showed that gait parameterization over low-dimensional spatially and temporally varying sine waves can serve as basis functions for the shape-space or central pattern generators (CPGs). Recent approaches to designing CPGs have combined annealed chain-fitting, which solves for joint angles that fit a snake robot to a desired backbone curve, and keyframe extraction, which then fits analytic shape functions to the resulting optimized joint angles. However, the non-convex optimization associated with these methods is fraught with local optima exacerbated by constraints such as actuator limits. Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a promising alternative for searching over such spaces. However, end-to-end RL approaches trained purely in simulation are vulnerable to reality distribution shifts, lack safety guarantees, and don't yield an intuitive representation of the learned gait. We propose a method that translates a gait found via policy search into a parametric representation of its component sinusoidal equations thus leveraging the strengths of both learning-based and classical approaches. Simulation and hardware experiments show that the proposed pipeline can generate parametric gaits where classical curve fitting-based approaches fail.}

    pages = {1728--1740},
    abstract = {The values of two-player general-sum differential games are viscosity solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. Value and policy approximations for such games suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Alleviating CoD through physics-informed neural networks (PINN) encounters convergence issues when value discontinuity is present due to state constraints. On top of these challenges, it is often necessary to learn generalizable values and policies across a parametric space of games, e.g., for game parameter inference when information is incomplete. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper a Pontryagin-mode neural operator that outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) on safety performance across games with parametric state constraints. Our key contribution is the introduction of a costate loss defined on the discrepancy between forward and backward costate rollouts, which are computationally cheap. We show that the discontinuity of costate dynamics (in the presence of state constraints) effectively enables the learning of discontinuous values, without requiring manually supervised data as suggested by the current SOTA. More importantly, we show that the close relationship between costates and policies makes the former critical in learning feedback control policies with generalizable safety performance.}

    abstract = {Deep neural networks are adept at modeling complex relationships between input and output variables. When trained on diverse datasets, they can understand not just the specifics of individual objects but also the broader principles governing an entire object class. This research applies this principle to building heating control, a domain marked by significant heterogeneity and constant environmental changes, including renovations and changes in user behavior. Our approach involves training the network on a wide range of data instances, enhancing its adaptability to newly distributed data representing unseen scenarios. We find that Transformer-based LSTM architectures are particularly adept for this task as they are able to remember previous tasks' learning. We propose a simple yet effective control algorithm that separates system identification and forecasting from the optimization-based control step. This separation simplifies the control process while ensuring robust performance. In a wide range of simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our ``universally trained'' neural network control can adjust to changing conditions, thus reducing the need for more complex continual learning techniques. Our results suggest that training neural networks on varied datasets empowers the network with the ability to generalize and adapt beyond specific training instances, which demonstrates their effectiveness in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.}

    pages = {1753--1764},
    abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of flexible objects has become an emerging topic in the community as these objects become more present in many applications, e.g., soft robotics. Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.}

However, inherent uncertainties, such as aerodynamic effects coupled with quadrotors' operation in dynamically changing environments, pose significant challenges for traditional, nominal model-based control designs. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task meta-learning method called Encoder-Prototype-Decoder (EPD), which has the advantage of effectively balancing shared and distinctive representations across diverse training tasks. Subsequently, we integrate the EPD model into a model predictive control problem (Proto-MPC) to enhance the quadrotor's ability to adapt and operate across a spectrum of dynamically changing tasks with an efficient online implementation. We validate the proposed method in simulations, which demonstrates Proto-MPC's robust performance in trajectory tracking of a quadrotor being subject to static and spatially varying side winds.}

    pages = {1777--1790},
    abstract = {We tackle the problem of policy learning from expert demonstrations without a reward function. A central challenge in this space is that these policies fail upon deployment due to issues of distributional shift, environment stochasticity, or compounding errors. Adversarial imitation learning alleviates this issue but requires additional on-policy training samples for stability, which presents a challenge in realistic domains due to inefficient learning and high sample complexity. One approach to this issue is to learn a world model of the environment, and use synthetic data for policy training. While successful in prior works, we argue that this is sub-optimal due to additional distribution shifts between the learned model and the real environment. Instead, we re-frame imitation learning as a fine-tuning problem, rather than a pure reinforcement learning one. Drawing theoretical connections to offline RL and fine-tuning algorithms, we argue that standard online world model algorithms are not well suited to the imitation learning problem. We derive a principled conservative optimization bound and demonstrate empirically that it leads to improved performance on two very challenging manipulation environments form high-dimensional raw pixel observations. We set a new state-of-the-art performance on the Franka Kitchen environment from images, requiring only 10 demos on no reward labels, as well as solving a complex dexterity manipulation task.}

    pages = {1791--1802},
    abstract = {Decision-making under uncertainty is a fundamental problem encountered frequently and can be formulated as a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. In the problem, the learner interacts with an environment by choosing an action at each round, where a round is an instance of an interaction. In response, the environment reveals a reward, which is sampled from a stochastic process, to the learner. The goal of the learner is to maximize cumulative reward. In this work, we assume that the rewards are the inner product of an action vector and a state vector generated by a linear Gaussian dynamical system. To predict the reward for each action, we propose a method that takes a linear combination of previously observed rewards for predicting each action's next reward. We show that, regardless of the sequence of previous actions chosen, the reward sampled for any previously chosen action can be used for predicting another action's future reward, i.e. the reward sampled for action 1 at round $t-1$ can be used for predicting the reward for action $2$ at round $t$. This is accomplished by designing a modified Kalman filter with a matrix representation that can be learned for reward prediction. Numerical evaluations are carried out on a set of linear Gaussian dynamical systems and are compared with 2 other well-known stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithms.}
