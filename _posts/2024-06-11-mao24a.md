title: "$\widetilde{O}(T^{-1})$ Convergence to (Coarse) Correlated Equilibria in Full-Information
  General-Sum Markov Games"
abstract: No-regret learning has a long history of being closely connected to game
  theory. Recent works have devised uncoupled no-regret learning dynamics that, when
  adopted by all the players in normal-form games, converge to various equilibrium
  solutions at a near-optimal rate of $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1})$, a significant improvement
  over the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate of classic no-regret learners. However, analogous
  convergence results are scarce in Markov games, a more generic setting that lays
  the foundation for multi-agent reinforcement learning. In this work, we close this
  gap by showing that the optimistic-follow-the-regularized-leader (OFTRL) algorithm,
  together with appropriate value update procedures, can find $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1})$-approximate
  (coarse) correlated equilibria in full-information general-sum Markov games within
  $T$ iterations. Numerical results are also included to corroborate our theoretical
  findings.
