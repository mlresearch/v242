title: Increasing information for model predictive control with semi-Markov decision
  processes
abstract: Recent works in Learning-Based Model Predictive Control of dynamical systems
  show impressive sample complexity performances using criteria from Information Theory
  to accelerate the learning procedure. However, the sequential exploration opportunities
  are limited by the system local state, restraining the amount of information of
  the observations from the current exploration trajectory. This article resolves
  this limitation by introducing temporal abstraction through the framework of Semi-Markov
  Decision Processes. The framework increases the total information of the gathered
  data for a fixed sampling budget, thus reducing the sample complexity.
